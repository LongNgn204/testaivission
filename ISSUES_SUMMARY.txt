RISK ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Current Risk Level: 🔴 CRITICAL

Risks:
1. Data Loss (Test results cannot be saved)
2. Security Breach (No input sanitization, weak JWT)
3. Poor User Experience (No error handling, no offline)
4. Unreliability (No retry logic, race conditions)
5. Accessibility Issues (No ARIA labels)

Risk Mitigation:
1. Fix all CRITICAL issues immediately
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Implement security best practices
4. Add retry logic and offline support
5. Add accessibility features
6. Comprehensive testing before deployment

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

IMMEDIATE (Today):
1. Fix CORS Authorization header (5 min)
2. Add missing endpoints (2 hours)
3. Fix race condition (15 min)
4. Test thoroughly (1-2 hours)

THIS WEEK:
1. Implement all HIGH priority fixes (6.5 hours)
2. Implement MEDIUM priority fixes (7.5 hours)
3. Comprehensive testing (4 hours)
4. Security audit (2 hours)

BEFORE PRODUCTION:
1. Deploy to staging
2. Final testing
3. Performance testing
4. Security testing
5. Load testing
6. Team training
7. Monitoring setup

AFTER LAUNCH:
1. Monitor logs
2. Fix issues quickly
3. Implement LOW priority fixes
4. Continuous improvement

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The Vision Coach application has a solid foundation with good code quality
and architecture. However, it has CRITICAL ISSUES that prevent it from
functioning properly.

The main problems are:
1. Missing backend endpoints
2. Security vulnerabilities
3. Incomplete error handling
4. No offline support

With focused effort on fixing the identified issues (estimated 28 hours),
the application can become production-ready.

RECOMMENDATION: Start with Phase 1 (CRITICAL fixes) immediately, then
proceed with Phase 2 (HIGH priority) before any production deployment.
